On April 22, 2025 (Earth Day), a non-profit organization is hosting a charity marathon to promote environmental conservation. The project manager will secure permits from local authorities and collaborate with eco-friendly brands for sponsorships and giveaways. Promotional materials emphasizing the cause will be designed, and online registrations will include an option for direct donations. Training sessions will be arranged for participants leading up to the marathon day. The route will feature hydration stations with reusable or biodegradable cups, ensuring sustainability. Volunteers will manage crowds, provide first aid, and oversee waste collection during the event. Social media updates with hashtags like #RunForEarth will keep audiences engaged throughout the marathon. After the event, photos of participants, sponsor acknowledgments, and a report on funds raised will be shared to highlight its success.

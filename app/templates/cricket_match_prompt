The cricket match marketing committee has an exciting lineup of tasks to ensure a successful event on January 1, 2025. First, the logo and theme need to be finalized, and the page logo and cover should be updated. Announcements will follow for the event, logo, and T-shirts, along with opening registrations. Posts will keep the audience engaged, including reminders about the T-shirt preorder deadline, registration updates, and partnership announcements for title, gold, silver, and bronze sponsors. Flyers and banners will highlight sponsors and deadlines. Teams will be announced, along with details about tournament awards, gift partners, and sub-events. A countdown will build excitement as the match day approaches, with posts on key milestones like “2 days more,” “1 day more,” and “Happening Today.” After the event, the committee will share highlights, including runners-up, champions, best performers, and a thank-you message to students. The after-video and a photo album will wrap up the campaign, showcasing the event’s success and engaging the community with memorable moments

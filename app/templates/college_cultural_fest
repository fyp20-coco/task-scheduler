A university is gearing up for its annual cultural fest from October 10–12, 2025, bringing together students for three days of vibrant activities. The project manager will form committees to handle events such as music competitions, dance battles, drama performances, and art exhibitions. A logo design competition will kick off promotions while sponsorships from local businesses and food vendors are secured. Marketing efforts will include posters on campus and social media campaigns featuring alumni influencers. Auditions for student performances will be held to finalize schedules for each event. The manager must arrange sound systems, lighting equipment, stage setups, and seating arrangements while also organizing workshops like pottery-making or photography during downtime between performances. Live-streaming key events on social media platforms will engage a wider audience. After the fest concludes, highlights such as winners’ announcements and behind-the-scenes moments will be shared to celebrate its success.

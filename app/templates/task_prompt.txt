Today is {today}. Use today as the starting date for task scheduling.
Analyze the following description and identify actionable tasks.
Provide a stepwise  breakdown for each task with start times, end times,
summaries, and detailed descriptions. 

Return the output strictly in a JSON format (do not provide any additional formatting or commentary). Pay close attention to the "time_estimation" field: the value must be strictly formatted as HH:MM (e.g., if a task takes 2 hours, use "02:00").time_estimation should be given on 00:00 (HH:MM) format
Output should be a JSON object with the following structure:

Description: "{description}"
Deadline: {deadline}
Priority: {priority}
Type: {task_type}
